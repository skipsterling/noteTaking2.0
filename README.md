# noteTaking2.0

## Description
I have created this app to write down notes and save them so that I can refer back to them in the future. Almost like a todo list or to simply share what i'm thinking. If you make a mistake or no longer need the note you can also delete it.
Once the notes are saved the data will be stored as a JSON file that is in the repository.
I have used Expressjs and uuid to create this app.
